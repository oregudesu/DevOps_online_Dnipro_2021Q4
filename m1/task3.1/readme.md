# Module 3 Networking Fundamentals

## Task 3.1

1. I've rounded three networks: Enterprise, Home Office and Data Center, designed 'em and connected all devices with each other by Copper Straight-Through wires (step 1):

![created networks with connections](./images/1.png?raw=true)

2. I set static IP addresses to all user devices in Enterprise network according to step 2:

![enterprise network's addresses](./images/2.png?raw=true)

And I tried to ping this network devices from Client1 (step 3):

![pinging Enterprise network's devices from Client1](./images/3.png?raw=true)

Looks like they see each other, it works.

3. Like described in the step 4 I set static IP addresses to all Data Center servers:

![Data Center network's addresses](./images/4.png?raw=true)

And I pinged every device in the network for test (step 5):

![pinging Data Center network's devices from Web Server1](./images/5.png?raw=true)

I renamed all devices so their names on further screens are different.

4. I changed an adapter in Client3 device to wireless and set a static IP address to it (steps 6-7):

![wireless connection for Client3 device](./images/6.png?raw=true)
![static IP address for Client3 device](./images/7.png?raw=true)

Then I pinged wifi-router from Client3 device in Home Office network (step 8):

![pinging wifi-router](./images/8.png?raw=true)
