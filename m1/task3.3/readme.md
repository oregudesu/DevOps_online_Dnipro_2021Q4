# Module 3 Networking Fundamentals

## Task 3.3

### Setting up routing

1. I got hurried and have already set routing in previous task (3.2). There's a screen how I set it up (step 1):

![routing tables in three routers](./images/1.png?raw=true)

2. I've set an IP address, subnet mask and default gateway for the Home router (step 2):

3. I checked routing between Client1 from Enterprise network to Web Server 2 from Data Center network (step 3):

![pinging and tracing from Client1 from Enterprise network to Web Server 2 from Data Center network](./images/3.png?raw=true)

4. Then I removed all static routing from all routers (step 4). Instead of that I added RIP routing (step 5):

And checked connection between networks (step 6):

![checking connection between networks](./images/5.png?raw=true)

Everything works fine!
